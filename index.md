# Description

Description: Unlike some big cities, Hanover does not provide us much entertainment. Most of students have no idea what to do in their leisure time. So we would like to design an application that can provide students some options about what to do, where to eat and what to read.Our app will have several parts, for example, in activity page people can share information of all kinds of activities including place, date etc. In movie page, people can search the movie that they are interested in. Also, they can write review and rate the movie.
